SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are 
OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity
Paste the SQL statement you used below.


Well here I decided to do an inner join that will show just what match in both, but
We could do also a left outer join that will show the intersection and all of the rows from the left table
Or we could do a right outer join which will show the intersection and the right rows from the right table. This exercise was not very specific what kind of join should we show you

SELECT od.OrderID, p.ProductName, od.Quantity 
FROM OrderDetails as od INNER JOIN Products as p
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables 
to return a report with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT  e.EmployeeName, o.ProductID, od.Quantity
FROM ((Orders as o
INNER JOIN  OrderDetails as od o.OrderID = od.OrderID)
INNER JOIN  Employees as e o. EmployeeID =   e.EmployeeID);
